A To-Do Command Line Program.

![Compiling-macOS](https://github.com/mrmalac/termtodo/workflows/Compiling-macOS/badge.svg)


## Building the program
### macOS
Use ```make mac``` to compile termtodo. If you want to add it permanently to your Command Line Programs place the compiled binary in ```/usr/local/bin```.

### Windows
I couldn't test on Windows so I don't really know if termtodo_win.cpp will work.
