## Building the program
### macOS
Use ```make mac``` to compile termtodo. If you want to add it permanently to your Command Line Programs place the compiled binary in ```/usr/local/bin```.

### Windows
I tested it on Windows. It doesn't show an error in the compiler, but it doesn't output any file either.
