A To-Do Command Line Program.

![Compiling-macOS](https://github.com/mrmalac/termtodo/workflows/Compiling-macOS/badge.svg)

## Building the program
### macOS
Use ```make mac``` to compile termtodo. If you want to add it permanently to your Command Line Programs place the compiled binary in ```/usr/local/bin```.

### Windows
I tested it on Windows. It doesn't show an error in the compiler, but it doesn't output any file either.
